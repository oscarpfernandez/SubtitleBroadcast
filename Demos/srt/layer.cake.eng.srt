1
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,990
When I was born,
the world was a far simpler place.

2
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,870
It was all just cops and robbers.

3
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,020
Fucking get down! Get down now!

4
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,300
And you! Stay down! Stay down!

5
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,260
But it wasn't for me.

6
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,580
Then came the Summer of Love.

7
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:51,860
Hashish and LSD arrived on the scene.

8
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,030
There were villains locked away for
12 years for robbing a bank of 10 grand,

9
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,790
doing time with drippy hippies
doing 12 months

10
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,590
for smuggling two million quid's
worth of puff.

11
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,390
I mean, work it out, mate.
We're in the wrong fucking game.

12
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,780
Drugs changed everything.

13
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,060
Always remember that one day all
this drug monkey-business will be legal.

14
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,340
They won't leave it to people like me
when they figure out

15
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:43,100
how much money there is to be made -
not millions, fucking billions.

16
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,780
Recreational Drugs plc.
Giving people what they want.

17
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,820
Good times today, stupor tomorrow.

18
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,820
But this is now.

19
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,820
So, until prohibition ends,
make hay while the sun shines.

20
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,830
I'm not against it.

21
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,820
I'm a businessman whose commodity
happens to be cocaine.

22
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,740
Ten years ago, Charlie was for pop stars
or a celebrity's birthday bash.

23
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,830
It was demonized by Daily Mail readers
getting drunk in naff wine bars.

24
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,140
Now they're my biggest clients.

25
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,940
This is Clarkie. Double first at Cambridge
in Industrial Chemistry.

26
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,820
Well, he's got to pay off
his student loan somehow.

27
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,750
Today, I only deal in kilos.

28
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,540
Depending which tariff you use,

29
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,220
that'll cost you either 28 grand
or 15 years in prison,

30
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,470
which is more time than a rapist.

31
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,140
C'est la vie.

32
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,740
It is vital that we work
to a few golden rules.

33
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,780
Always work in a small team.

34
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:09,540
Keep a very low profile. Only deal with
people who come recommended.

35
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,420
It's like selling anything -

36
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,910
washing machines,
hand-made shoes, blow-jobs.

37
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,820
As long as you don't take the piss,
people will always come back for more.

38
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,150
That's not to say we don't weave that
magic that makes two kilos into three,

39
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,020
but never be too greedy.

40
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,140
Know and respect your enemy.

41
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,710
It is only very, very stupid people
who think the law is stupid.

42
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,860
And avoid like the fucking plague

43
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,900
loud, attention-seeking
wannabe gangsters,

44
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,620
in it for the glory, to be a face,
to be a name.

45
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:56,430
Hello, Slavo. Yeah, this is Duke.

46
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,910
Everything's sweet. When can we meet?

47
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,150
They don't mean to fuck up. They just do.

48
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,990
Forgive me for stating the obvious,
but stay away from the end-user.

49
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,710
They are guaranteed to bring you trouble.

50
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,060
As do guns.

51
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,470
I hate guns. And violence.

52
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,870
But as some Roman general once said,

53
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,110
"If you seek peace, plan for war.

54
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,100
Morty and his assistant Terry,
they watch my back.

55
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,430
Morty learnt caution the hard way.
He did ten years inside.

56
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:46,460
He's my bridge to the criminal world, and
he ensures that the traffic is one way.

57
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,750
Look, there's Amsterdam,
and there's Oofdorfe...dorfe.

58
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,390
Not a fucking clue.
None of them speak English.

59
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,230
- Get in the car. I'm sure it's that way.
- Move up.

60
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,230
- I bet you it's that way.
- We've already been that way.

61
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,340
Yeah, but we're gonna go that way again.
Give us the map.

62
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,940
Oh, don't start, the pair of you.

63
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,540
It's like being out with a pair of kids.

64
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,430
- All day you've been moaning.
- It can't be that difficult.

65
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,350
How many fucking greenhouses
can there be?

66
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:21,060
Morty.

67
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,670
Terence.

68
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,100
Clarkie.

69
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,940
Very, very important.:
pay your supplier prompt.

70
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:34,270
In our case, that's Mr. Jimmy Price.
He's the top of the pyramid.

71
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,350
Pay him. In full, on time, without fail,
no short counts.

72
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,590
You get no second chances.
Jimmy calls the shots.

73
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,150
Where the fuck is Gene?

74
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,790
- I don't know. Ask me one on sport.
- What time does your watch tell?

75
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,870
- The same as yours.
- He's never late.

76
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,300
Shut the fuck up.

77
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,220
Patience.

78
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,990
Gene here is Jimmy's right-hand man.

79
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,150
Been with him since way back.

80
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,990
All the drugs and cash go through Gene.

81
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,470
Jimmy trusts him with his life.

82
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:17,420
By the way, Jimmy would like to see
you tomorrow for a spot of lunch.

83
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,270
Wait a minute. Is there a problem?

84
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,940
Why does everybody assume there's a
problem, just because he wants a word?

85
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,460
Maybe he's grateful.
He fucking should be.

86
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,500
See you at Stoke Park at one.

87
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,110
This is just so beautiful.

88
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,590
We need to get in and out
of here sharpish.

89
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,700
Paul and the tide ain't gonna wait.

90
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,060
Everyone likes to walk
through a door mark ed "Private".

91
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,660
Therefore, have a good reason
to be affluent.

92
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,430
I own a share
in a very successful letting agency.

93
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:09,670
It gives me an honest income.
Looks good on the self-assessment.

94
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:16,660
Whereas years ago scallywags
were trying to get money out of banks,

95
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,660
now your problem is
how to get your ill-gotten gains in.

96
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,670
That's a job for Mr. Singh.
He does my laundry.

97
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,260
And in a week,
it will be ready for collection,

98
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:31,620
in the form of a nice, clean cheque
for a round million.

99
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,940
The business is on the up and up.

100
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,140
But I've always said,
have a plan and stick to it.

101
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,260
Quit while you're ahead.

102
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,300
So barring any fuck-ups,
I'm leaving it all behind.

103
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,500
No, we got the parcel.

104
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,910
Yeah, better than expected, actually.

105
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,630
It's just that things have gone
a little bit slightly turbo this end.

106
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,060
Come on, boys, lively, lively.

107
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,390
If we miss this tide, we're
not going anywhere till daylight.

108
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,380
Paul, you ain't being paid to moan.
You're being paid to get my cargo home.

109
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,500
Come on, babe. You all right?
Careful here, it's a bit wobbly.

110
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,940
Life is so fucking good,
I can taste it in my spit.

111
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:21,510
I'll treat tomorrow's lunch like a Last
Supper, feign interest in his tales.

112
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,990
And then leave quietly forever.

113
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,380
This is pure class.

114
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,940
Please, follow me, gentlemen.

115
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,350
Mr. Price is in the Oval Room.

116
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:55,580
- Your guests, Mr. Price.
- Thanks, Angelo. Welcome. Sit down.

117
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,590
How is it with that
Paki accountant I put your way?

118
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,780
- He still doing the business?
- Raj is doing a very good job.

119
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,550
Good. Paying your bit
of straight-goer's tax, eh?

120
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,500
We all have to do our bit.

121
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,510
Say hello from me
next time you see him.

122
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,310
You hungry? The grub here
will make your bollocks tingle.

123
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,260
Let's eat.

124
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,780
Right.

125
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,300
We've gotta test the snap-crackle-and-pop
factor on these babies.

126
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:29,340
Don't ask me.
I ain't fucking touching 'em.

127
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,750
You are a miserable bastard,
you really are.

128
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,260
- Brian.
- What?

129
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,180
Sit down, mate. Got a little treat for you.

130
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,020
Help yourself.

131
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,780
A little privacy, please, Angelo.

132
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,300
What do you want, son?

133
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,740
- Excuse me?
- In life. What are you after?

134
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,710
A shot at the title? A seat by the band?

135
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:36,540
Well, I don't know, Mr. Price.
That's a very expansive question.

136
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,140
Right, expansive. Good answer.

137
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,550
Years ago, people would've
thought you were a homosexual,

138
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,470
using a word like "expansive" .

139
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,180
- You're not a homosexual, are you?
- No.

140
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:50,270
- Not behind with the rent?
- No.

141
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,590
No, I didn't think you were.

142
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,780
No harm in it, I suppose. Times change.

143
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,590
You know why people like you
can't leave this business?

144
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:09,030
Because you make too much money
for people like me.

145
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,700
Anyway, I'll get to the point.
I need a favor.

146
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,060
I need someone who's a bit cute,
a smooth operator.

147
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,470
Not a two-a-penny loud-mouth.
Too many grasses around.

148
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:24,780
- It would be a pleasure, Mr. Price.
- Jimmy. You can call me Jimmy.

149
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:29,780
Now, this favor. It's not for me, truth
be told. It's for a good friend of mine.

150
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,220
Like a blood-brother.
We were at school together.

151
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,230
Now he's a right wheeler-dealer.

152
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,260
Flinging up skyscrapers.
His wife's a proper blue blood.

153
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:45,580
I'll give you a clue. Eddie Temple.
Does that name mean anything to you?

154
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,380
- I know who you mean.
- Now, Eddie's got a daughter.

155
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,420
Charlie, bless her.

156
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:54,260
The light of his life.
He worships the ground she walks on.

157
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,030
She's a proper beauty, Charlie.

158
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,380
Or to give her her correct moniker,
Charlie Spencer-Temple.

159
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,030
But she ain't behaving like a lady.

160
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,060
She's hooked on the white powder
and loves a wrong 'un.

161
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:11,020
This is where you come in, right?
You're gonna find her.

162
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:15,470
- Find her?
- She's gone missing.

163
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,790
Well, you should get a private detective.

164
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:23,990
Oh, right. Some nosy ex-policeman,
still on the Scotland Yard payroll?

165
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,180
She's done a runner from a drug
rehabilitation unit in the West Country.

166
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,620
Rehab.

167
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:35,110
She got loved up in there with some
fucking low-life crackhead called Kinky.

168
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,270
I reckon they've gone back to London.

169
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,220
I wouldn't know where to begin.

170
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,220
Now and then we're asked
to do something beyond the call of duty.

171
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:49,700
It's called sacrifice, son.
Ask Gene. Ask Morty.

172
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:54,070
- I'll do my best.
- You do your best and find her.

173
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,700
Keep Mr. McGuire posted.

174
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,460
I've also got a little business
more in your usual line.

175
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,340
Gene'll fill you in.

176
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,540
Everything was to your satisfaction?

177
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,260
- Fucking excellent, Angelo.
- Thank you.

178
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:19,260
" Details, details.
Things to do, things to get done.

179
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,590
" Don't bother me with details.
Just tell me when they're done."

180
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,990
- Who said that, son?
- Winston Churchill?

181
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:32,220
Close. No, I said it.
James Lionel Price. Good boy.

182
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,500
I'll see you at the yard tomorrow.
Say, four.

183
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:44,070
Tell you about that bit of business.
I've set up a meet for five with the Duke.

184
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,860
- What's with him?
- He's just had one of these.

185
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,190
These are super Es. We'll make millions!

186
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,940
I don't care. This is my boat-yard.

187
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,220
I want those pills
and that fucking idiot out of here now.

188
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,230
- I can't afford to get nicked.
- Paul. Calm down, mate.

189
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:10,740
I've got Gene coming down
with a buyer. You'll be in your whack.

190
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,780
Here, chill. Have a pill.

191
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,820
Gene, why are we doing business
with the Duke?

192
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,500
Yeah, why are we dealing with this joker?

193
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:25,780
He's a fucking maniac, a relic,
a throw-back, belongs to the Dark Ages.

194
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,060
Will you just shut the fuck up?

195
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:31,230
We're dealing with him because
he has 1 million Ecstasy pills

196
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,100
of very high levels of MDMA, OK?

197
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,380
One million?

198
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,630
Gene, that is a lot of pills.
What's the tax on that?

199
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,740
Jimmy wants 50%/ netto.

200
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,620
Love a bit of cloak-and-dagger, this lot.

201
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,820
Oh, yeah. Driving a bright yellow
Range Rover. Very subtle.

202
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,070
Calm down. You'll feel better
once you've got your money.

203
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,630
But how much can you spend
in Parkhurst or the Scrubs, Gene?

204
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,180
Come on.

205
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:04,590
Oh, don't go getting Duke at it. Jimmy
doesn't want him fucked about, OK?

206
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,430
Who? Me?

207
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,510
Don't you fucking talk to me
like I'm some kind of mug.

208
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:15,310
Duke, don't take this personally.
It's business.

209
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,580
You want to know
how much they're worth.

210
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,700
Yes! Fucking! Please!

211
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,350
Just because you pay a fiver a pop
down the local cattle market,

212
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,230
don't, for fuck's sake,
think these pills are worth millions.

213
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,660
They're not.

214
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,700
We've got to find a buyer.

215
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:35,270
They've got to split them into parcels.
They've got to find these people.

216
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,220
You'd give a fucking aspirin
a headache, pal.

217
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:43,110
Then you've got currency fluctuations,
police activity, adverse publicity.

218
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:47,430
Who has got the readies lying around
to pay for a million Es?

219
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,590
- This is fucking bollocks!
- Slasher, shut the fuck up!

220
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,830
- Duke, we all want a good deal.
- Mate, mate, mate.

221
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:02,230
Mate, look, that parcel of pills
has got to be worth five million easy.

222
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,660
- £5 each, yeah!
- You are fucking joking.

223
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,620
It doesn't work like that!

224
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:11,300
Don't keep fucking saying that to me!

225
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:15,140
I've got some samples.
I'll stay in touch through Gene, OK?

226
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:20,420
You wouldn't be so fucking flash
if you didn't have him behind you.

227
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:24,020
Yeah, well, he fucking has, ain't he?

228
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,750
Where did these monkeys
get a million Es?

229
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,510
Don't worry about that.
Can you place them?

230
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,510
We know someone up North who'll buy.

231
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,420
Morty, set up a meeting
with Trevor and Shanks in Liverpool.

232
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,940
What's really bothering me
is what color to get the Aston.

233
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,220
As you're driving it yourself,
probably green.

234
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,020
- Green?
- Yeah.

235
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,220
That's a trifle dull, I thought.
What do you think, girls?

236
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,990
Black. Yeah, black.

237
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,580
Black's the color for a hearse or a taxi.

238
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,990
Don't be so conservative.
Black's a splendid idea.

239
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,150
Hello. Look who it is.
Sit down. Do join us.

240
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,030
- Can we have a word?
- Our dreary broker has arrived.

241
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:09,190
Hugo, follow me.

242
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,780
Don't go anywhere.
Drink some more champagne.

243
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,190
Especially you.
I like it when you're drunk.

244
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,910
- You're the master of that.
- What are you up to?

245
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,500
We're doing the number
on these American birds.

246
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,140
- Who am I today?
- The Earl of Oxford.

247
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,230
- The Earl of Oxford.
- Fucking hell.

248
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,260
- What's this business, then?
- It's a bit strange.

249
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,900
Can you find somebody
for me really quickly?

250
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:39,420
- How quickly?
- 20 grand quickly.

251
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,590
You've got our attention.

252
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,740
Oh, very nice.
I suppose this is the boyfriend?

253
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,180
It's a bit unusual for you.
What's going on?

254
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,350
- It doesn't matter. Can you do it?
- Yeah.

255
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,670
Should be a doddle.
All the same, junkies and crackheads.

256
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,830
Chuck 'em a few quid, they'll cough.

257
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,590
- Is there anything else?
- No.

258
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,700
We must get back to work, old boy.

259
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,190
Look...

260
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:17,830
All right, mate. I'm the Duke's nephew.

261
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,830
Remember me? Sidney.

262
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:23,710
Sidney. Yes. Hello, mate. How are you?
I'm just off. Have a nice night.

263
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,630
How you doing?
What you doing here?

264
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,790
I hear you're doing business
with my uncle, the Duke.

265
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,500
Why don't you tell
the whole fucking room?

266
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,270
- This is Tammy.
- Who's your mate, Sidney?

267
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:42,020
He's a good mate of my uncle's, the Duke.
He was just going.

268
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,910
Yeah, well stick around and have a drink
before you do, yeah?

269
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:53,060
- Yeah, all right.
- I got VIP down here. Nice little booth.

270
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,500
Charisma, he's fucking got it.

271
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,990
I know he's my uncle and all that,
but you can't deny it.

272
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:08,820
If you want anything, just tell me,
'cause I got 'em straightened out in here.

273
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,940
If you want any running about,
I'm your man...

274
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,060
- Line?
- What?

275
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,700
I said do you want a line?

276
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:47,460
No, mate. You knock yourself out.

277
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,910
Lovely, isn't she? Isn't she a darling?

278
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,670
Isn't she?

279
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,510
Siddy, baby, I could do with a livener.

280
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:09,380
Sidney, it's been great. I'll see you, man.
Thanks for the champagne.

281
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,550
All right.

282
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,580
You let me know when you're happy,
Mr. Lucky.

283
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,180
- Too warm down your way?
- We're kept busy, Trevor.

284
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,990
- Everyone wants a slice as well.
- Same wherever you go. Greedy people.

285
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,830
Yeah, it's all clear, Shanks.

286
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:45,420
You lot would know all about that,
wouldn't you?

287
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,750
What the fuck's that, Shanks?

288
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:52,100
Well, not you lot, but...

289
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,780
...that team down your end.
Like you don't know.

290
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,710
No offence, but what the fuck
are you talking about?

291
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,110
You really do surprise me,
do you know that?

292
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,510
Do you know something we don't?

293
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:09,830
Don't be giving it
the big fucking innocent, pal.

294
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:14,580
Because I am not a fucking prick.

295
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:19,500
- I never said you were, Shanks.
- Cool it, Shanks. They really don't know.

296
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,070
- Explain.
- I was over in Amsterdam.

297
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,070
Last weekend, right?

298
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:29,550
The whole place is alight with a rumor

299
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,790
about how this hooligan outfit
from down your end,

300
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:37,670
run by this joker called the Duke...

301
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:43,580
- Gazza, go and find them fucking pills.
- All right. Come on. Have a look in here.

302
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:49,220
They skanked this outfit,
a proper, nutty Serbian militia.

303
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:53,260
You're the first person ever to be
foolish enough to steal from me.

304
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,790
Shut up.

305
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,030
But you're not the first
to point a gun at me.

306
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:59,060
Shut up or I'll be the last.

307
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,580
Fuck me.

308
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:06,430
They got lucky.
He'd just knock ed up a massive batch.

309
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:11,660
Fucking jackpot. There's fucking
millions of the fuckers in here.

310
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,980
Stay down there. Yes?

311
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,540
You watch them.

312
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:27,590
- That looks very heavy for you, darling.
- Fuck off.

313
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:34,030
- Why don't you put it down?
- Why don't you shut up?

314
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:38,460
- A little girl playing games with guns.
- I ain't no little girl. Shut up!

315
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,740
- You are shaking.
- Fuck off!

316
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,590
- Look at your arm.
- Fuck off!

317
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,860
- Put it down.
- Why don't you listen to me?

318
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,180
- Sit down!
- Fuck off!

319
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,470
Baby, baby, baby, baby!

320
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:08,190
Come here. Come here.
Baby, calm down, calm down.

321
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:15,950
This will not be the end of this,
Mr. Duke, believe me.

322
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:19,940
Gazza, go and load them pills.

323
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:24,190
But he got unlucky because this lot
are wanted for fucking war crimes.

324
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:28,380
Mass murder, ethnic cleansing.
They're lunatics.

325
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:33,350
They're wanted by the United
fucking Nations. Think about that.

326
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,030
Let's get this clear.

327
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:40,620
Duke has absolutely sweet fuck-all
to do with us, understand?

328
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,820
Everyone in Amsterdam
believes that he has.

329
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,620
- Bandied your names about.
- What?

330
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:51,270
Word on the street is they've unleashed
their top boy. His name is...

331
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,620
His party piece, right,

332
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,660
is lopping people's heads off
then fetching them back to his boss.

333
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:14,340
It's all about honor and respect with
these head-banging nationalist outfits.

334
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:19,260
They can't have it getting about that
anybody has took liberties with them.

335
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:23,300
But we had nothing to do with
the acquiring of said merchandise.

336
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:26,310
OK, we accept that.

337
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:30,980
But with you lot up here punting
this shipment, how does it look?

338
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,420
Bad.

339
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:40,420
You do know that we're only
talking pennies an article?

340
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:45,420
- Stolen goods.
- You won't want them, then.

341
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:53,950
Sit down, lah. Let's not be too hasty.
Me and him need to have a little think.

342
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:57,620
Don't think too long. Someone's
gonna make a killing on these pills.

343
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:02,140
They already have.
That's the problem, kidder.

344
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:09,700
That prick Duke's made us look
a bunch of fucking amateurs.

345
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:13,740
I told you he was trouble. But he ain't
gonna drag me down with him.

346
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:17,070
Try Gene again. What a fucking show-up!

347
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,470
- He's not answering, Mort.
- OK.

348
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,420
Try Jimmy at home.

349
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,590
- You sure?
- Will you fucking ring him?

350
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:33,630
- Where are we going, Morty?
- Back to that boat-yard.

351
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:39,220
- Somebody's about to get a fucking slap.
- Yes, Morty. About fucking time.

352
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,460
Paul?

353
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:32,580
What a way to go. An iron burning a hole
in your chest until your heart boils.

354
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,750
Paulie would've told him anything, then,
wouldn't he?

355
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:42,830
You see, that's what happens
when you do business with loons.

356
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:50,060
Clarkie, have a sniff about. Make some
phone calls, but really quietly.

357
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,940
Find out where the Duke's holed up.

358
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,710
We're gonna need an insurance policy.

359
00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:00,060
What's the fucking idea of phoning me at
home and leaving messages, you prick!

360
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:05,110
- Jimmy, it was an emergency.
- Don't fucking call me Jimmy!

361
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:11,060
And what's the idea of telling Duke
those pills ain't worth shit?

362
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,230
You don't know
the problems you've caused.

363
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,710
And don't be leaving it to that pair
of ponces, Cody and Tiptoes,

364
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,580
to find that bitch Charlie.

365
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,430
I fucking told you to do it!

366
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:27,020
Are you listening?
Find a buyer for those pills.

367
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,540
The person moving those pills
met a nasty end.

368
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,980
I don't give a fuck!

369
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,990
- That was quick.
- The gaff is rotten in there.

370
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:05,310
- Kinky's still here, isn't he?
- Didn't Tiptoes tell you?

371
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,390
Tell me what? Have you let him go?

372
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:12,030
No, I haven't. He's in here.

373
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,830
Kinky.

374
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,750
I still want to be paid.

375
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:39,510
So, if I'm correct, you three gearheads
are gonna be clucking very soon.

376
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:43,340
In fact, you're gonna be climbing
the walls any minute, aren't you?

377
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,020
But I'm prepared to do you a favor.

378
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,870
We can do this one of two ways.

379
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:53,430
We can do it the nice way,
which I think you'll prefer.

380
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,940
Because the other way
is my friend takes you

381
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,220
and puts your head
through the window!

382
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:03,110
Right, so, was Charlie here with Kinky?

383
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:07,220
Yeah, she was here for a couple of days.
Kinky turned up with five grand.

384
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,260
- Who's giving Kinky five grand?
- We don't know.

385
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:13,590
They kept arguing. She was saying,
"Do you think it's that easy

386
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:17,150
"taking the five grand?"
But she was still caning the rocks.

387
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,020
Where is she now?

388
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,980
Brighton. She kept begging
Kinky to go with her.

389
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:25,900
The other night, I hears this noise.
I'm looking out there. It's dark.

390
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:30,630
But I sees this geezer all in black.
It's like something out of a kung-fu film.

391
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:35,220
- Pay no attention to him. He's a nutter.
- Shut the fuck up.

392
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:39,180
And you, fucking tell him now.
What geezer?

393
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:43,350
I don't know. I goofed out myself.

394
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,020
The next morning,
she's gone and Kinky's dead.

395
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,590
You telling me
that somebody's topped Kinky?

396
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:51,300
Kinky overdosed.
He always was a greedy fucker.

397
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,470
I saw it with my own eyes, man.

398
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,580
You smoke too much
of that fucking crack!

399
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,940
Shut the fuck up!

400
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,110
- You twat!
- Shut the fuck up!

401
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,580
Get the fucking money!

402
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:05,380
Morty! Morty!

403
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,820
This is dodgy.
That kid's talking about murder.

404
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,910
He's talking shit.
Get to Brighton and finish the job.

405
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:13,990
- It all smells a bit fishy.
- I'll double your money.

406
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:18,100
- All right. And ten G for finding Kinky.
- That wasn't the fucking deal.

407
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:21,310
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

408
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:28,820
Hello. Ambulance, please.

409
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:32,310
185 Kirby House, Kings Cross.

410
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:37,110
There's a dead boy. The door's open.

411
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:40,380
My name...?

412
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,150
185 Kirby House.

413
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,740
I'm not happy.

414
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:04,820
This shit is out of control.
You sort it out or I'll sort you out.

415
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,310
Morty, Kinky OD'd, that's all.

416
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:14,430
Charlie woke up, found him cold,
freaked out, fucked off down to Brighton.

417
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,780
Cody's gonna find her.

418
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,900
Look, I'm gonna freshen these teas up.
They're cold.

419
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,110
Morty?

420
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,790
Is that you?

421
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,140
Where you been hiding, then, eh?

422
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:42,580
Fucking hell. What you doing
down this neck of the woods?

423
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:47,150
Hello, Freddie.

424
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,190
So...

425
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:10,150
...Mr. Mortimer.

426
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:14,790
Here, Morty, couldn't spare us a few quid,
for old times' sake?

427
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,820
You look well flush, bruv.

428
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,980
Fuck me, he's loaded.

429
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:30,100
Here, couldn't make it five, could you...

430
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,630
...mate?

431
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,260
- Let's make it ten.
- Yeah.

432
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,430
Ten's...

433
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,190
...a nice...

434
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,260
...round number.

435
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,550
What's the matter?

436
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:06,260
What's happening? Been away?
Yeah. Ten fucking years.

437
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:14,030
Going off? Or do you need a red light?

438
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,500
Stop, Morty. Enough. He's had enough.

439
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:24,830
- I'll tell you when he's had enough.
- What the fuck is this?

440
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,740
But let's forget about all that.

441
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:37,180
Let's have a cup of tea, Mr. Hurst.

442
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,790
What the fuck?

443
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:07,780
I'm sorry about that.
I won't be around for a while.

444
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,660
- It's me.
- Hey.

445
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:22,070
Come on up.
I'll leave the door open.

446
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:51,420
- How's your day been so far?
- Very fucking funny.

447
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:56,460
Have you eaten?
I'll have a Chinky sent up.

448
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,150
No, I'm fine, thank you.

449
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,220
Gene, who the fuck is Freddie?

450
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:05,220
He used to run with me, Morty and Jimmy
in this real kamikaze firm.

451
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,820
In those days, we were headed up
by this guy called Crazy Larry.

452
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,420
Yeah. Got shot, didn't he? Bit of a lunatic.

453
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,510
That's an understatement.
They were a spun-out bunch.

454
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,670
Always doing loads of drugs.

455
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,500
- Not worried about keeping a low profile.
- I love you.

456
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,860
Turn over anyone
who couldn't go to the law.

457
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,380
No fucking problem. Boys will be boys.

458
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:30,340
Until one of them, Kilburn Jerry...

459
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,140
...shoots himself stone dead.

460
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,860
This is a bit of a dilemma.

461
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:39,700
This desperate posse can't call the law
or an ambulance.

462
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:42,710
Morty, out of some mad
fucking sense of loyalty,

463
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,110
actually volunteered
to dispose of the body.

464
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:48,300
No head. But things went a bit wrong.

465
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:53,820
The guy Larry told to help him
was Freddie Hurst.

466
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:57,470
The total imbecile
had fallen asleep at some traffic lights

467
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,260
in a drunk en, drug-induced stupor.

468
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:05,310
Morty was still shut up in the van with
the headless body of Kilburn Jerry.

469
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:08,150
Being black
was even worse than being Irish.

470
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,260
They threw the book at Morty.

471
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,780
Freddie got three years
for aiding and abetting.

472
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:16,110
Morty did ten years because
Freddie Hurst fell asleep?

473
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,430
But he kept his mouth shut.

474
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:22,620
Did his bird.
Earned a lot of respect for that.

475
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:27,300
All because some kid was being ridden
against his will by a psychotic lunatic.

476
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:31,740
- Who?
- But you, you fuck!

477
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,270
Larry.

478
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:37,220
- Crazy Larry was gay.
- He was never gay.

479
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:40,740
- Larry used to say...
- Fucking females is for puffs.

480
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,150
So who shot Crazy Larry?
A boyfriend?

481
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,260
Probably.

482
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:50,260
Larry made enemies very easy. Took
liberties with too many straight lads.

483
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,030
Not for me.

484
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,820
Listen, son. Let me explain
something to you.

485
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:03,310
Freddie's in intensive care
with a bit of a brain hemorrhage.

486
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:08,310
You were there at the scene.
That's called joint venture.

487
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:11,710
Now, if Freddie dies,
you're either in the dock with Morty

488
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:16,670
or you're in the witness box
putting him away. Think about that.

489
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,950
You know, I will have one of those.

490
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,460
- All right, fellas?
- Where's Duke?

491
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,980
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

492
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:40,420
- I don't know. I thought he was here.
- Well, go and fucking find him.

493
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:45,230
He's probably having a night out
while us mugs baby-sit these.

494
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:51,540
Gene, what the fuck
am I gonna do about these Serbs?

495
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:58,020
Come here. I have something for you.

496
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:08,790
- You're gonna need one of these.
- Fuck me, Gene.

497
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:14,430
I fucking hope not. Are you trying
to scare the shit out of me?

498
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,270
I mean, I fucking hate guns.

499
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:20,540
Although that one is really pretty.
Is that Second World War?

500
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,310
Hey, point it upwards.

501
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:27,430
Oh, for fuck's sake.

502
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:32,020
Here, let me see if it's loaded.

503
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,300
You look like
you could do that blindfolded.

504
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,660
I can and I do.

505
00:39:54,870 --> 00:40:00,310
I find it very relaxing.
Good for meditation.

506
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:06,070
Meditation is concentrating the front
of the mind with a mundane task

507
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,740
so the rest of the mind can find peace.

508
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:16,180
And you find peace with guns.

509
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:20,350
Well, on occasion. It has been known.

510
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:26,270
Listen. I know it's not your thing.

511
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:33,340
But if you ever have to kill somebody,
never, ever tell a living soul.

512
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:55,020
- Who is this?
- My name is Dragan.

513
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,180
How did you get this number?

514
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:04,510
Boatman Paul gave me your number,
in the end.

515
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:08,180
I believe you have some property
that belongs to my employer,

516
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:11,990
and you're the person I should talk to
about the return of this cargo,

517
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,700
stolen by your associate, the Duke.

518
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:18,740
Dragan, the Duke
is nothing to do with me.

519
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:23,790
Mr. Duke came to Amsterdam,
used your name, said he work ed for you.

520
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:30,180
- Are you listening?
- Dragan...

521
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:38,150
I've got an idea. Why don't
you come round for breakfast?

522
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:41,900
I'll squeeze some orange juice
and we'll talk about this like adults.

523
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:45,260
- How does that sound?
- Sounds very hospitable.

524
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,190
- Do you know where I live?
- No.

525
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,950
Well, fuck off, then.

526
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,660
Duke's gone missing.
He's a fucking liability.

527
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:05,990
The pigs are everywhere.
This was meant to be easy. No sweat.

528
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,470
Calm down, Gazza.
I'm sure Duke's just fine.

529
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:13,420
Well, you've got 48 hours to find a buyer
or I'm sending 'em back, OK?

530
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:16,540
Now, listen.
Don't do anything stupid, Gazza.

531
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:20,430
It ain't worth the grief. We've gone
underground, off the radar.

532
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,940
Nothing personal,
but I don't trust you.

533
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:39,780
Listen, I just had a phone call
from Gazza.

534
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:44,590
Being a cry-baby. Threatening
to offload those pills in 48 hours.

535
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:48,830
Between you and that gobshite Duke,
he's promised Jimmy a bumper pay-day.

536
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:51,500
- So get busy.
- I said to Jimmy I'd try and...

537
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,540
He put yous together.

538
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:56,580
You and Duke. That's his job.

539
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:02,260
If you two can't make music, he's gonna
want his whack out either way.

540
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,340
That's business.

541
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:21,380
- I hope you put this Dragan straight.
- Yeah. I told him to fuck off.

542
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:24,230
What? Please tell me
you're fucking joking.

543
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:27,340
Well, I am beginning to regret it now.

544
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:31,830
We've got to find the Duke,
find these fucking pills.

545
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,540
We can't rely
on these monkeys to call Gene.

546
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:37,220
We've looked everywhere.
There's no sign.

547
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,500
You can't find any of his firm?

548
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:44,550
Maybe this Dragan geezer's already found
the Duke and done the business.

549
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,820
Yeah, well, there is someone I can call.
Keep looking.

550
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:50,910
Wait. You're gonna leave it to us?

551
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:54,550
This Dragan geezer is phoning me.
I am the target.

552
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:59,510
And if we don't find the Duke,
this, everything, all over.

553
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:09,750
- It's me. Sidney's mate.
- Oh, hiya.

554
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:13,230
- What took you so long to call?
- I've been busy.

555
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:16,150
- You sound sleepy. You just woken up?
- Not long ago.

556
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:20,950
- So when am I gonna see you?
- What are you doing now?

557
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:25,750
Nothing. No, I was just lying in bed,
wondering what to do.

558
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:31,100
- You still in bed?
- Yeah.

559
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:41,230
- You lying there naked?
- I've got a little T-shirt on. But that's all.

560
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:43,500
Here, wait, listen to this.

561
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:48,220
What's that?

562
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:51,070
I was just rubbing the phone
against my fanny.

563
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:55,420
Did you like it?
My, oh my, it's fresh this morning.

564
00:44:55,630 --> 00:45:01,870
Look at my nipples, standing up like
little soldiers. What is a girl to do?

565
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:07,140
Tammy, why don't we meet up now?
I'll book a table for lunch.

566
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:08,580
St Martin's Hotel.

567
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:11,590
Don't worry about a table.
We'll have room service.

568
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:13,620
- Yeah, OK.
- One hour.

569
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:50,510
Hang on.

570
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:26,310
Oh, shit.

571
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:32,020
Oh, leave it off, Sidney.
He's driving me fucking mad.

572
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:41,700
- We're not expecting Sidney, are we?
- He's too busy kissing Duke's arse.

573
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:43,390
Not round here, I hope.

574
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:47,740
No, over by Greenwich market.
So you can relax. It's just the two of us.

575
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:00,380
Patience. All good things
come to those who wait.

576
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:04,660
Stay put.

577
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:28,470
Hello, it's me. It's me. Shut up and listen.

578
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:32,710
Sidney, Duke's nephew is working down
by Greenwich Market. Go and look.

579
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:37,620
- Room service.
- Look for that yellow Range Rover.

580
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:40,140
OK.

581
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,070
- Your champagne, sir.
- I didn't order...

582
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:19,750
One moment, Mr. Troop. I want to hear
what this bastard has to say for himself.

583
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:35,380
I'm Jimmy's old colleague, Eddie Temple.

584
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,260
- Fuck!
- He told you to locate my daughter.

585
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:41,750
Hunt her down like some lost mongrel.

586
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:46,220
He said you asked for his help.

587
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:52,510
Mr. Troop could find anyone
on the planet in ten minutes flat.

588
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:58,310
If you'd laid a finger on my daughter,
you'd be over the edge like that.

589
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:00,230
You'd join that shit, Kinky,

590
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:03,550
who thought he could take my five grand
and fuck me over.

591
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:09,220
The audacity. How fucking dare you?

592
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:12,870
I've known Jimmy Price for 45 years.

593
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:15,660
It pays me to keep an eye on him.

594
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:20,180
Do you know what a remora fish is?

595
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:24,300
- Yes.
- Oh, you do?

596
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:29,700
Well, Jimmy has been swimming
in my slipstream all my fucking life.

597
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:33,900
I thought he might put some
volatile psychopath on the job.

598
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:37,260
But I've checked you out, son.
You're a smart boy.

599
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:40,620
But you keep very, very bad company.

600
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:46,950
You know, I host
a charity golf tournament every year.

601
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:50,300
Quite an event in the social calendar,
if I do say so myself.

602
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:55,740
I like to invite Jimmy. Some of my friends
find him absurdly hilarious.

603
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:58,620
Drinks are on me. Drinks for everyone.

604
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:01,580
Champagne.
Fucking good gear and all.

605
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:07,390
But I've come unstuck in my attempts
to provide a spectacle for my chums.

606
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:10,630
Jimmy, as usual
on the look out for tidbits,

607
00:50:10,830 --> 00:50:14,900
has met the development minister
of some tin-pot republic.

608
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:17,470
They're trawling the West
for investments.

609
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:22,590
They have vast natural resources.
Quite an investment for the right man.

610
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:26,500
They've sent in men from Timbuktu
explaining all the details.

611
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:31,500
Profits, shares, long-term investments,
short-term investments.

612
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:37,740
They've even made him an honorary
citizen. Even made him one of the tribe.

613
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:41,910
What we didn't know,
until it all ended in tears,

614
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,340
was that the hard-line
communist insurgents

615
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:48,230
who control the country
outside the mining areas...

616
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:51,020
Bad news about our little venture, Jim.

617
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:53,030
The communists have broken through.

618
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:55,380
Heading for the capital
with little resistance.

619
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:57,420
What the fuck are you on about?

620
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,670
I got word they were planning a push.

621
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:01,940
The final coup de grâce. I told Jimmy.

622
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:03,900
- It's all over.
- Fuck's sake!

623
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:07,630
- Keep your voice down.
- Get my money out quick, now.

624
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:11,430
As if it was some little kiddie's
piggy bank.

625
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:15,750
Now, I explained that wasn't possible.
We thought we'd bought a government.

626
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:18,510
Maybe someone made a better offer.
Forget about it.

627
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:20,220
You win some, you lose some.

628
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:22,550
How much are we talking?

629
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,470
It's only a cheeky half-mill, Jim.

630
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:28,190
- It's much more than that.
- How much?

631
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:31,220
- 13.
- 13 what?

632
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:37,510
- 13 million pounds. I'm fucked.
- Have you gone fucking mad?

633
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:45,260
13 million pounds!
How could you be so fucking stupid?

634
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:48,110
You've been right grafted,
royally turned over.

635
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:51,830
- Like some Yank buying London Bridge.
- Don't talk to me like that.

636
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:53,860
He accused me of instigating it.

637
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,430
It's no coincidence
I met them at your tournament.

638
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,460
Are you fucking demented?

639
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:00,820
Asked me to fly to Zurich
to see the minister,

640
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:04,740
still parked up
in La Maison Grande, still eating well.

641
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:09,710
Big fat fucker.
On little Jimmy's nest egg.

642
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:13,510
Jimmy thought he'd keep Charlotte
hostage while you went to get his money.

643
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:18,580
Little Jimmy was so stupid,
he thought he couldn't lose either way.

644
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:20,020
I'm sorry, what?

645
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:23,140
If you find Charlotte,
he's got his hostage.

646
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:25,550
If I find you trying to find her,

647
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,470
I do his dirty work.

648
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:32,580
- I'm still not with you.
- Your lives are inextricably linked.

649
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:37,550
I've found out something
very interesting about Jimmy,

650
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:39,420
something I've long suspected.

651
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:45,940
But I'll let Jimmy explain.

652
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:48,620
You follow me.

653
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:37,070
You've no doubt suffered Jimmy's

654
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:40,180
" CID was geezers you
was at school with" routine?

655
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:42,270
The other chap's Albert Carter.

656
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:44,940
Another twisted bastard
from the old neighborhood.

657
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:49,540
Member of the Regional Crime Squad.
Sit back, relax and enjoy.

658
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:52,260
It ain't like your lot in the old days.

659
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:55,140
- They've all gone squeaky.
- Tell me about it, Jim.

660
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:59,060
I have to box clever with those
college boys from Anti-Corruption.

661
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:04,420
- Fucking dogs. Slags. Ten grand?
- It's the going rate, Jim.

662
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:07,950
Ten K. Hardly seems worth the bother.

663
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:13,350
Well, there's only so much
in those informer funds.

664
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:19,550
What about Gene?
Does he suspect anything?

665
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:24,300
What? About me working
for the old firm? Listen. Gene...

666
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,630
...is too loyal for his own good.

667
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:31,590
- I don't fucking believe it.
- You better believe it.

668
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:34,940
- 'Cause it's fucking happening.
- Where did you get this?

669
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:37,230
Mr. Troop made it for me.

670
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:42,620
- It's one of his little hobbies.
- I don't fucking believe it.

671
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:46,380
Don't you want to hear
what Jimmy has to say about you?

672
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:51,430
I've got one for you.
Pluck ed and ready for the pot.

673
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:55,180
- Just give us a name and he's gone.
- In time.

674
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:57,980
I don't want a bunce.
I want him out of the way.

675
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:01,870
Flash young runt.
One of the new breed, ain't he?

676
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:06,110
Reckons he can just waltz off
into retirement.

677
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:08,870
I want him away for 12.

678
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:12,270
If he's got a kilo of class A,
he's looking at double figures.

679
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:15,190
- I'll put it there myself.
- Sounds personal.

680
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:18,110
He's got a few quid .
He'll come in handy.

681
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:22,350
I set him up with that slippery accountant
in the first place.

682
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:24,860
Fucking rag-head let slip, didn't he?

683
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:29,270
"You will miss him when he's gone,
Mr. Price. "

684
00:55:29,470 --> 00:55:34,070
Is that you, the flash runt
who thinks he's retiring?

685
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:37,420
You'd no idea what Jimmy was up to?

686
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:40,020
How do you think these fuckers
earn a living?

687
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:44,380
I would've thought a smart young man
like you would know that already.

688
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:47,900
- Can I have that?
- Mr. Troop.

689
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:52,500
Thank you.

690
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:58,540
This looks like you, son.
Smart part of town.

691
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:02,140
I'll keep an eye open. Must dash off.
Get home. Wash and brush up.

692
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:05,420
Opera tonight. The Damnation of Faust.

693
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:10,230
Man sells his soul to the devil. All ends
in tears. These arrangements usually do.

694
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:22,660
One more thing, young man.

695
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:26,550
Always remember, the art of good
business is being a good middleman.

696
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,710
Bye-bye.

697
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,620
Fuck!

698
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:13,540
- I've got him.
- Got who?

699
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:16,700
Sidney, remember? Yellow Range Rover?

700
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:19,660
Seems they sent our friend out
for something to eat.

701
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:22,590
Good. Tell Morty.

702
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:26,430
- So what do we do now?
- Call Morty.

703
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:43,260
Shut up and listen.
No more insults, no more games.

704
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:46,590
If I do not get my cargo back,
you're a dead man.

705
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:51,740
Dragan, I've been doing some checking.

706
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:54,020
- I've found out who you represent.
- Good.

707
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:56,820
I can point you towards
your boss's merchandise.

708
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:58,620
- Come to my hotel...
- Look...

709
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:03,590
- I'd rather meet you in a public place.
- You have nothing to fear.

710
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:08,660
- I'm a reasonable man.
- That's not what I've heard.

711
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:11,100
I'll meet you at...

712
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:16,910
I'll meet you
at Greenwich Park Observatory.

713
01:04:17,110 --> 01:04:19,830
- Any taxi will drop you off.
- I can read a map.

714
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:23,580
- Tomorrow. Midday.
- Tomorrow at 12.

715
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:26,710
I'll be there.

716
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:33,500
That's rude, Mr. Dragan.

717
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:46,790
It's Conditions Red down there.

718
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:50,820
They're didgy as fuck.
They haven't moved from that lock-up.

719
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:53,990
Have a look at the geezer at the front,
on the door.

720
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:59,750
I know him from somewhere.
This could get messy.

721
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:01,750
What about the blokes in red?

722
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:04,260
Mechanics.
They got a ringing coup going on.

723
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:07,220
The lorries come in one color,
go out another.

724
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:09,580
But they're nothing to do with the Duke.

725
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:12,220
- Fuck me, look who it isn't.
- Who's that?

726
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:16,780
It doesn't matter. I've got work to do.

727
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:20,110
- Stay here. Those pills move, call me.
- You got it.

728
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:23,380
- Day and night, Terry.
- What do you mean " night"?

729
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:27,190
- I've been here all day. Get Clarkie.
- Day and fucking night. Got it?

730
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:52,310
Hello, young man. Thank you
for coming at such short notice.

731
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:56,300
I hope you didn't feel too summoned.
How are you?

732
01:05:56,510 --> 01:06:00,470
I'm in the best of health, Mr. Temple.
Thank you for asking.

733
01:06:01,310 --> 01:06:03,540
- How are you keeping?
- I'm very well.

734
01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:07,030
- How was the performance of Faust?
- Complex.

735
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:10,140
No wonder it took him 60 years to write it.

736
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:12,260
How's the family?

737
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:14,350
What is this? A vicar's tea party?

738
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:17,430
You do sometimes take
your conversations away with you.

739
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:19,830
Being a clever bastard, are we?

740
01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:23,780
- How do I know you're not wired up?
- Well, I'm not.

741
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:27,540
Then we'll have to trust each other,
won't we? Sit down.

742
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:36,500
I've been thinking, after
our chat the other day.

743
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:40,020
Your pills. How much for the lot?

744
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:44,150
No, I've already got a buyer.

745
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:47,500
Nearly took my hand off.
He's putting the money together now.

746
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:49,990
I told you, lah. I'm still thinking.

747
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:53,340
It's only been three days.
What's the fucking hurry?

748
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:56,190
- What's he paying?
- It's confidential.

749
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:58,510
Don't be an idiot.
Let me match his offer.

750
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:01,460
They've got history.

751
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:03,950
Bad juju.

752
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:08,140
And, anyway, this Serbian maniac's
in hot pursuit.

753
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:13,110
If I sold them to you, I'd have to
disappoint him. And he is definitely not...

754
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:18,340
I did you a big fucking favor
letting you know about Jimmy.

755
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:20,860
I think you owe me.

756
01:07:22,590 --> 01:07:25,870
2œ million in sterling and euros,
high-denomination used notes.

757
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:30,380
So if I gave you three million,
that would keep everyone happy.

758
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:32,390
Let me state my position.

759
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:35,830
You can sell these pills
to whoever you like.

760
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:39,260
That's your privilege.
That's your business.

761
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:41,590
But I'll tell you,

762
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:46,860
I'll be very, very unhappy
if you don't sell 'em to me.

763
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:49,140
You understand?

764
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:56,740
OK, Mr. Temple. Three million. Done.

765
01:07:58,030 --> 01:08:01,910
- My buyer's not gonna be happy, though.
- Fuck him. He'll get over it.

766
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:13,100
I'm gonna need some help.

767
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:18,030
Someone who can eliminate the problem.
Someone who's a bit handy.

768
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:20,980
Whoa! Slow down, kidder.

769
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:25,670
Mr. Lucky does a drop of freelance work.

770
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:29,910
I don't need to know.
It's none of my business.

771
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:34,140
You tell him when,
and he'll come down on the train.

772
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:38,230
Thanks, Trev.

773
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:40,430
Excuse me.

774
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:46,060
Mr. Temple.

775
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:50,780
You deliver them to my warehouse.
When do I get my consignment?

776
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:53,420
Monday. No, Tuesday, probably.

777
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:56,060
Tuesday? I'm paying
over the odds, remember?

778
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:59,580
England! Typical. Even drug dealers
don't work weekends.

779
01:09:13,110 --> 01:09:15,580
That's good news.
That should cheer Gene up.

780
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:19,700
Yeah, everything's under control.

781
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:26,710
- Cody's been chasing his ten grand.
- Yeah. I'll call him later.

782
01:09:32,110 --> 01:09:34,580
- Hey, Geno, what's up?
- Got some good news.

783
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:36,270
Oh, yeah? What's that?

784
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:39,350
- You murdering bastard!
- Open the fucking door!

785
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:42,990
- Stay out of this, Morty.
- Gene!

786
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:47,780
- Murder? Who's dead?
- Jimmy.

787
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:50,870
He killed him.
Blew his fucking head away.

788
01:09:51,070 --> 01:09:54,510
- Open this fucking door!
- Why?

789
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:57,100
Open this fucking door!

790
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:05,270
- Get off him.
- No, listen, listen. Just listen.

791
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:10,700
Listen to me, Morty.
I got a call from a cozzer we've got bent.

792
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:13,220
They found Jimmy's body last night.

793
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:16,500
In his own backyard.
It was this sly bastard.

794
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:18,940
He's no killer.
Somebody's made a mistake.

795
01:10:19,150 --> 01:10:21,820
All right, look. Here. We'll see.

796
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:23,620
Read it. Read it out loud.

797
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:27,740
"To senior ranks only. Murder Squad
investigation. James Lionel Price."

798
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:30,260
Read the fucking ballistics report.

799
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:34,300
" Preliminary ballistics report. No arms
recovered. Disintegrated on impact.

800
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:36,180
"One recovered cartridge casing."

801
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:40,430
You forgot to take the cartridge case.
You got sloppy.

802
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:42,590
" ...consistent with weapon used

803
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:48,150
" in unsolved homicide of Lawrence
Gower a.k.a. Crazy Larry Flynn."

804
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:52,980
Wait. I got it. Whoever killed
Crazy Larry must've killed Jimmy.

805
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:57,180
No, no. The gun.
The fucking gun was the same.

806
01:10:57,390 --> 01:10:59,750
The one he stole from my flat.

807
01:10:59,950 --> 01:11:04,500
- You killed Crazy Larry?
- So?

808
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:08,020
- This fucker killed Jimmy.
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

809
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:16,550
- Why did you do it?
- He was an informer.

810
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:21,540
- He was a police informer!
- Jimmy a grass? Are you fucking mad?

811
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:25,350
- You'll have to do better than that.
- I've got a recording at home.

812
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:28,830
Of Jimmy and a cozzer
called Albie Carter.

813
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:34,100
Gene, let's listen to this shit.

814
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:37,990
If he's lying, we'll both fucking kill him.

815
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:40,310
Mr. Mortimer reckons

816
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:45,900
the Tylers are bringing in shooters
from Jamaica via Manchester.

817
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:49,260
They got someone in Immigration
straightened out.

818
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:53,540
I don't think anybody gives a fuck
about spades shooting spades.

819
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:58,220
Don't you care
about dead darkies, Albert?

820
01:11:58,430 --> 01:12:02,340
What about Gene?
Does he suspect anything?

821
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:05,300
What? About me working for the old firm?

822
01:12:07,670 --> 01:12:09,660
Convinced?

823
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:15,940
You don't fuck about, do you?

824
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:24,860
Jimmy was skint, huh?

825
01:12:25,070 --> 01:12:28,350
That's why he set up the whole
Amsterdam business with Duke.

826
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:36,550
I really think we should keep
all of this to ourselves, right?

827
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:38,710
Really?

828
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:43,270
Why did you kill Larry?

829
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:48,790
Funnily enough,
it was Jimmy who persuaded me.

830
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:51,740
Jimmy never liked Larry.

831
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:55,180
Look at that wrong 'un waving
his money around. It ain't right.

832
01:12:56,270 --> 01:12:58,550
Hey, I love you, man.

833
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:04,220
He saw the future was drugs
and it needed to be run like a business.

834
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:06,580
Crazy Larry
was no fucking businessman.

835
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:09,260
After that business with Kilburn Jerry...

836
01:13:09,470 --> 01:13:13,300
That's it, son. You do him. Bollocks!

837
01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:15,950
...he wanted him gone.

838
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:21,830
I didn't have any problem doing him.

839
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:28,150
That's why I did it.

840
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:30,660
But why did you keep the gun?

841
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:34,420
Sounds silly now, but it was my favorite.

842
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:38,780
I hope you don't tell the other guns
you've got favorites.

843
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:46,940
So what's the next move, boss?

844
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:53,190
Well, I'm going to bed.

845
01:13:53,390 --> 01:13:57,070
I don't know what you two are doing.
We can talk about it tomorrow.

846
01:14:29,190 --> 01:14:30,990
Sorry?

847
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:37,550
Sorry, mate, what was that?

848
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:40,790
Would you pack that in?
I've got a fucking test next week.

849
01:14:40,990 --> 01:14:43,660
OK. OK, I'm sorry. I was just saying...

850
01:14:58,310 --> 01:15:00,900
So when does the target get here, then?

851
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:04,150
The target? The target's gonna be here
at exactly midday.

852
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:05,580
Where?

853
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:07,910
- Here, right fucking here.
- Got a photo?

854
01:15:08,110 --> 01:15:10,150
- Don't worry about it.
- Who's worried?

855
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:13,340
I'll have some binoculars.
I'll give you a little signal.

856
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:16,750
I could get the 13.10 home from here.

857
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:18,510
Let's have a little recce.

858
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:22,860
After we do the business,
walk slowly back.

859
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:25,660
Remember, it's a stroll in the park.

860
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:27,910
Don't run, whatever you do.

861
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:31,310
The first five minutes,
nobody'll have a clue what's going on.

862
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:34,420
Hopefully, it'll be mayhem.

863
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:40,980
So try to stay relaxed.

864
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:45,060
Don't do anything
to draw attention to yourself.

865
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:47,260
Or me.

866
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:53,020
Afterwards, take me to the Underground
station. I'll look after myself.

867
01:15:56,790 --> 01:15:58,020
There.

868
01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:02,260
Time?

869
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:06,390
Six minutes to twelve.

870
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:11,380
I hope he's not gonna be late.

871
01:16:14,830 --> 01:16:18,060
- Maybe he'll be early.
- That'll be nice.

872
01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:31,660
Can you see that guy on the left?

873
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:41,710
- Big fella, marching up the hill.
- That's our man.

874
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:48,070
- Are you sure?
- For fuck's sake. I'm gonna call him.

875
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:51,590
It's up to you. You're the client.

876
01:16:58,190 --> 01:17:02,070
- As soon as he answers, he's gone, OK?
- Okey-dokey.

877
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:07,710
Stand by.

878
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:13,350
Now.

879
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:18,350
Hello, may I help you?

880
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:24,940
Don't move a muscle.

881
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:29,270
- Do I have your attention?
- Yes.

882
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:34,670
You English, you have no idea
of honor and respect.

883
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:40,820
I usually kill for less.
I want my cargo and the Duke.

884
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:43,780
I haven't got your pills.
Just give me a day.

885
01:17:46,150 --> 01:17:49,510
Don't piss in my pock et
and tell me it's raining.

886
01:17:49,710 --> 01:17:51,380
Now listen for the last time.

887
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:55,950
- You'll bring me what is mine.
- Look, I don't... Jesus!

888
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:59,980
You have one more day.

889
01:18:01,230 --> 01:18:06,990
See you tomorrow at dusk by the statue.
Remember, I will be watching you.

890
01:18:15,510 --> 01:18:17,390
What the fuck were you thinking?

891
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:22,750
Getting Trevor's man down here
to shoot this Serb in a park!

892
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:27,420
Trevor's gonna go ballistic.
Now, what the fuck do I tell him?

893
01:18:27,630 --> 01:18:29,860
- What a fucking mess.
- You've gone mad.

894
01:18:30,070 --> 01:18:31,820
- Think you're a gangster?
- Fuck off!

895
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:34,230
You want to play?
You do it somewhere else.

896
01:18:34,430 --> 01:18:37,710
If you do it near me,
I'll put you in a fucking wheelchair.

897
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:40,580
Stick to your fucking sums.

898
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:43,820
Listen. Listen to me.

899
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:46,180
Dragan's killed Paul.
He's done the Duke.

900
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:49,700
He's just put a bullet
between Lucky's eyes. I was there!

901
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:52,500
He's watching our every move.
Who's next, me?

902
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:56,750
- I wish.
- Fuck off! It could've been you or Morty.

903
01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:03,380
Dragan said he wanted the pills
and the Duke. Where's the Duke?

904
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:09,580
What?

905
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:14,820
I should've told you this earlier.

906
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:18,510
Duke and Slasher
came by the office the other day.

907
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:23,660
Paul the boatman was topped last night.
I've got to get on my toes sharpish.

908
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:26,380
I want Jimmy
brought here right now, yeah?

909
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:30,900
Getting that smug fucking yuppie bastard
to tell Duke those pills were useless,

910
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:33,260
after sending us over in the first place.

911
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:35,300
Hang on, you've lost me now.

912
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:39,950
If you have us over, I swear by fucking
almighty God, I'll call the fucking law.

913
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:42,710
- What are you talking about?
- I'll call the law.

914
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:44,820
She didn't mean that. She's upset.

915
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:47,700
Shut the fuck up!

916
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:08,180
That's where playing
at being a gangster gets you.

917
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:11,030
You're not in there 'cause I like you.

918
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:15,700
I'm beginning to feel left out.

919
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:17,340
Why?

920
01:20:17,550 --> 01:20:20,060
Freddie Hurst is still in intensive care

921
01:20:20,270 --> 01:20:23,580
after your jolly little reunion
the other day.

922
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:26,020
Fucking hell, Duke.

923
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:28,620
For once, you might be of some use.

924
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:48,420
That was Gazza on the phone. It's on.

925
01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:52,380
He'll pick you up at nine in the morning.
Gallows Corner. You know it?

926
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:53,860
Yeah.

927
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:59,540
With Jimmy gone, these pills will make
a nice contribution to my retirement fund,

928
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:02,340
so don't fuck things up again, OK?

929
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:08,630
If you do, you'll wish this Dragan had
shot you between the eyes, understand?

930
01:21:09,950 --> 01:21:11,910
Best of luck.

931
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:15,270
Thanks.

932
01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:38,180
Fuck off!

933
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:41,780
Sidney, I've told you,
stop answering my phone, OK?

934
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:43,630
- Who was it?
- Wrong number.

935
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:22,340
- All right?
- Hello, Sidney.

936
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:25,780
- How you doing, then?
- I'm all right. How are you?

937
01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:27,550
I'm all right, mate, yeah.

938
01:22:55,830 --> 01:23:00,540
Gazza, this place stinks. We want to
get you out of here. 50 pence a pill.

939
01:23:00,750 --> 01:23:02,900
That way, we all come out
with something.

940
01:23:03,110 --> 01:23:08,230
- I think they're worth more than that.
- This is a reality check.

941
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:12,180
Paul's dead, Jimmy's dead. Duke and
Slasher, fuck knows where they are.

942
01:23:12,390 --> 01:23:15,300
This gear is knock-off,
and the Serbs you nicked it from,

943
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:17,710
they'd kill you like you'd take a piss.

944
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:22,500
Gazza, the Old Bill are outside!

945
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:25,780
- Gazza, no!
- Go, go, go!

946
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:28,740
- Let's have it!
- Don't point that gun at me.

947
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:31,020
- Put it down!
- We're going in!

948
01:23:31,230 --> 01:23:34,830
Gazza, look at me. Put it down.
You're gonna get us all shot.

949
01:23:36,190 --> 01:23:37,910
Fuck it! Boat!

950
01:23:57,990 --> 01:23:59,950
Stay there!

951
01:24:11,070 --> 01:24:12,710
Fuck!

952
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:19,750
Come on!

953
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:31,340
- Gazza, wait!
- Fucking hurry up, then!

954
01:24:31,550 --> 01:24:33,110
Get in.

955
01:25:21,190 --> 01:25:22,670
Is this for me?

956
01:25:26,310 --> 01:25:28,110
Yes.

957
01:25:35,870 --> 01:25:38,620
Your cargo's gone, I'm afraid.

958
01:25:38,830 --> 01:25:41,740
- It was seized by...
- I know already.

959
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:45,100
- How do you know?
- I watched.

960
01:25:45,310 --> 01:25:48,460
I don't believe this.
Captain's gonna go fucking spare!

961
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:51,870
We are in shit.
You lot have fucked up again.

962
01:25:52,070 --> 01:25:54,820
Oh, fucking hell.

963
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:57,670
Leave it to me, lads.
I'll explain to Inspector Cox

964
01:25:57,870 --> 01:26:01,020
that his suspect has scarpered
'cause of your blundering.

965
01:26:01,230 --> 01:26:03,190
Knobheads. Helmets off.

966
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:14,140
Does this settle things, then?

967
01:26:33,870 --> 01:26:36,300
Tango Foxtrot, over.

968
01:26:36,510 --> 01:26:38,980
Delta Uniform...

969
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:48,500
How did that other errand go?

970
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:51,590
Success, as far as I could make out.

971
01:26:54,990 --> 01:26:57,300
Where is my fucking prisoner?

972
01:26:57,510 --> 01:27:00,390
- You old ladies couldn't catch a cold.
- Sir, I just...

973
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:03,060
Shut up, you soppy wanker.

974
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:05,660
- Indigo...
- Dingo Bongo.

975
01:27:06,790 --> 01:27:09,510
- Is this area now secure?
- Yes, sir.

976
01:27:09,710 --> 01:27:11,110
You can fuck off, then.

977
01:27:12,110 --> 01:27:15,340
So where are the pills, genius?

978
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:17,940
I think this is them now.

979
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:23,340
What the fuck?

980
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:28,380
- Couldn't leave this behind.
- Greenies.

981
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:34,660
You are in the wrong game.
You should work with us.

982
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:38,830
- Are we square?
- Yeah, we're sweet.

983
01:27:39,030 --> 01:27:42,070
It seems so. Your pills
are in the back. Help yourself.

984
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:18,740
Hello.

985
01:28:20,190 --> 01:28:24,260
OK. Yes, I will do. Bye-bye.

986
01:28:27,990 --> 01:28:31,620
You're off the hook, Morty.
Freddie Hurst is out of his coma.

987
01:28:34,950 --> 01:28:36,750
Good news.

988
01:28:37,790 --> 01:28:40,180
- Yeah.
- Good news, mate.

989
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:42,620
Listen, I've got one for you.

990
01:28:42,830 --> 01:28:45,220
Irishman caught his son snorting Charlie.

991
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:49,660
He said, " If I catch you doing that again,
I'll rub your fucking nose in it."

992
01:29:14,150 --> 01:29:17,030
- Do you have the pills?
- In the cars.

993
01:29:18,870 --> 01:29:20,990
Boss wants to see you in his office.

994
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:31,900
Come in. Sit down.

995
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:39,390
Here you are. Payment.

996
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:54,740
- You look shocked, son.
- Are you taking the fucking piss?

997
01:29:54,950 --> 01:30:00,980
You and Jimmy have caused my little
angel Charlotte considerable anxiety.

998
01:30:01,190 --> 01:30:04,310
She's off to Arizona
for a course of intense treatment.

999
01:30:04,510 --> 01:30:08,300
I'm keeping those pills for myself,
by way of compensation.

1000
01:30:08,510 --> 01:30:12,900
I think I'm entitled. Simple. End of.

1001
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:16,740
The amount of trouble
you've caused the last few days.

1002
01:30:16,950 --> 01:30:18,670
Jimmy.

1003
01:30:18,870 --> 01:30:20,940
Poor little Jimmy.

1004
01:30:21,670 --> 01:30:23,420
It would be in your interests

1005
01:30:23,630 --> 01:30:26,700
if this thing finishes here, now, today.
Understand?

1006
01:30:27,790 --> 01:30:31,580
It doesn't matter what I do.
This lot are gonna come after you.

1007
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:35,900
They're too long in the tooth
to rampage round the country,

1008
01:30:36,110 --> 01:30:39,150
looking for revenge. Look at 'em.

1009
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:42,980
Bunch of under-endowed,
ageing fuck pigs.

1010
01:30:43,190 --> 01:30:44,860
Are you enjoying this?

1011
01:30:45,070 --> 01:30:47,980
No. On the contrary.
Take it as a compliment.

1012
01:30:48,190 --> 01:30:50,070
You're a bright young man.

1013
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:53,070
This monkey business is in your blood,
under your skin.

1014
01:30:53,270 --> 01:30:57,100
You're not getting out, you're just
getting in. I've every faith in you.

1015
01:30:57,310 --> 01:31:03,910
One day, it will be you sitting here telling
some young Turk the facts of life.

1016
01:31:05,870 --> 01:31:07,830
And they are, Mr. Temple?

1017
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:17,140
You're born, you take shit.

1018
01:31:17,350 --> 01:31:20,660
Get out in the world, you take more shit.

1019
01:31:20,870 --> 01:31:24,990
Climb a little higher, you take less shit.

1020
01:31:25,190 --> 01:31:27,860
Until one day, you're up
in the rarefied atmosphere,

1021
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:30,380
and you've forgotten what shit
even looks like.

1022
01:31:33,110 --> 01:31:35,390
Welcome to the layer cake, son.

1023
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:54,540
This thing ends here, tonight.
You understand?

1024
01:31:55,190 --> 01:31:57,830
Drug money's easy money, not grief.

1025
01:31:58,390 --> 01:32:01,590
The odds, as you can see,
are against you.

1026
01:32:01,790 --> 01:32:03,020
Goodnight.

1027
01:32:35,670 --> 01:32:39,220
If you're gonna hang around in this game,
that's where you've got to be.

1028
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:43,390
In your bonded warehouse with
the ex-soldiers doing the dirty work,

1029
01:32:43,590 --> 01:32:45,660
while you deliver the suspect lecture

1030
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:49,100
to baffle your opponents
and cover your tracks.

1031
01:32:50,150 --> 01:32:54,270
The art of good business
is being a good middleman.

1032
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:58,670
Putting people together. I'll always
thank Eddie for telling me that.

1033
01:33:00,110 --> 01:33:02,940
It's all about honor and respect.

1034
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:07,030
This is the end, Mr. Duke, as I told you.

1035
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:55,060
Do you know what?
I fucking enjoyed that, brother.

1036
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:59,060
Just like the old days, Shanks.
A nice bit of armed robbery.

1037
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:03,660
All right? Where do you want
the money sent, lah?

1038
01:34:03,870 --> 01:34:07,340
I'll let you know as soon as I do.
Again, I am sorry about Lucky.

1039
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:12,620
Don't worry about it, kidder.
Man was a prick, anyway. Later.

1040
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:14,750
- Ready?
- Yeah. Let's go.

1041
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:19,300
Did I really think Eddie was gonna
give me three million for those pills?

1042
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:21,550
Did I fuck.

1043
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:25,710
But suddenly there was a void
where once there was Jimmy Price.

1044
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:30,300
And after a couple of days, Eddie's little
getting-in-and-getting-out speech

1045
01:34:30,510 --> 01:34:33,470
started to make sense.

1046
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:02,110
- Angelo. Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

1047
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:04,900
- Can we get some privacy?
- Of course.

1048
01:35:11,910 --> 01:35:13,710
The king is dead.

1049
01:35:14,590 --> 01:35:16,260
Long live the king.

1050
01:35:21,070 --> 01:35:22,740
Well, I'm honored.

1051
01:35:24,830 --> 01:35:28,060
But for me this is all over. I'm getting out.

1052
01:35:28,270 --> 01:35:30,420
What was true then is true now.

1053
01:35:31,310 --> 01:35:34,460
Have a plan. Stick to it.

1054
01:35:34,670 --> 01:35:37,100
So I'm sure you must have
lots to discuss,

1055
01:35:37,310 --> 01:35:39,670
but I have no business being here.

1056
01:35:41,590 --> 01:35:43,820
I've got someone to meet.

1057
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:47,310
Adios, amigos.

1058
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:58,460
Paul the boatman.

1059
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:00,100
Kinky.

1060
01:36:00,310 --> 01:36:01,540
The Duke.

1061

Slasher.

1062
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:05,190
Kilburn Jerry.

1063

01:36:15,230 --> 01:36:17,510
I don't want to add my name to that list.

1068
01:36:20,310 --> 01:36:23,060
My name? If you knew that,
you'd be as clever as me.

1069
01:36:23,270 --> 01:36:25,390
No!

1070
01:36:29,470 --> 01:36:31,430
I'm sorry.
